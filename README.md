# CrateAudioBooks
This code allows the user to create their own audiobook with just a text in any language.
This code provides a gui interface that allows the user to introduce a text in any language, and create an audio with that. The user
can choose any language for the audio, and also can pick the accent of the voice. The audio will be play immediately and also will be
downloaded in a .wav file.
